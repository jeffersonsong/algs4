/**
 *  The {@code TrieST} class represents an symbol table of key-value
 *  pairs, with string keys and generic values.
 *  It supports the usual <em>put</em>, <em>get</em>, <em>contains</em>,
 *  <em>delete</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>is-empty</em> methods.
 *  It also provides character-based methods for finding the string
 *  in the symbol table that is the <em>longest prefix</em> of a given prefix,
 *  finding all strings in the symbol table that <em>start with</em> a given prefix,
 *  and finding all strings in the symbol table that <em>match</em> a given pattern.
 *  A symbol table implements the <em>associative array</em> abstraction:
 *  when associating a value with a key that is already in the symbol table,
 *  the convention is to replace the old value with the new value.
 *  Unlike {@link java.util.Map}, this class uses the convention that
 *  values cannot be {@code null}â€”setting the
 *  value associated with a key to {@code null} is equivalent to deleting the key
 *  from the symbol table.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/52trie">Section 5.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
