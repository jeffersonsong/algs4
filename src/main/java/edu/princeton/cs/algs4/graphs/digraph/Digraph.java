/**
 *  The {@code Digraph} class represents a directed graph of vertices
 *  named 0 through <em>V</em> - 1.
 *  It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the digraph,
 *  iterate over all of the vertices adjacent from a given vertex.
 *  It also provides
 *  methods for returning the indegree or outdegree of a vertex, 
 *  the number of vertices <em>V</em> in the digraph, 
 *  the number of edges <em>E</em> in the digraph, and the reverse digraph.
 *  Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses an <em>adjacency-lists representation</em>, which
 *  is a vertex-indexed array of {@link Bag} objects.
 *  It uses &Theta;(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) space, where <em>E</em> is
 *  the number of edges and <em>V</em> is the number of vertices.
 *  The <code>reverse()</code> method takes &Theta;(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) time
 *  and space; all other instancce methods take &Theta;(1) time. (Though, iterating over
 *  the vertices returned by {@link #adj(int)} takes time proportional
 *  to the outdegree of the vertex.)
 *  Constructing an empty digraph with <em>V</em> vertices takes
 *  &Theta;(<em>V</em>) time; constructing a digraph with <em>E</em> edges
 *  and <em>V</em> vertices takes &Theta;(<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>) time.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
