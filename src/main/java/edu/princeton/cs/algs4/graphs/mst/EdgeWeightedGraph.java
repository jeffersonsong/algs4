/**
 *  The {@code EdgeWeightedGraph} class represents an edge-weighted
 *  graph of vertices named 0 through <em>V</em> â€“ 1, where each
 *  undirected edge is of type {@link Edge} and has a real-valued weight.
 *  It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
 *  iterate over all of the edges incident to a vertex. It also provides
 *  methods for returning the degree of a vertex, the number of vertices
 *  <em>V</em> in the graph, and the number of edges <em>E</em> in the graph.
 *  Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 *  By convention, a self-loop <em>v</em>-<em>v</em> appears in the
 *  adjacency list of <em>v</em> twice and contributes two to the degree
 *  of <em>v</em>.
